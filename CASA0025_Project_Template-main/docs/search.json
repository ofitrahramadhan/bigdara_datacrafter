Do not edit any of the headings.\n\nProblem Statement\nWhat is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?\n\n\nEnd User\nWho are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?\n\n\nData\nDatasets that we have used & the relevant data from the dataset which we have used are described below in detail:-\n\nUnited States Census Bureau TIGER Dataset It contains the boundary information i.e. counties of states which are the primary legal divisions units of US states.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“TIGER/2016/Counties”)\nDataset Provider: United States Census Bureau\nData Used for our Study: STATEFP parameter of the dataset which provides the State FIPS code & the North Dakota value is used. \n\n\nUSDA NASS Cropland Data Layers It is a crop-specific land cover data layer created annually for the continental United States using moderate resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truth.\n\nDataset: ee.FeatureCollection(“USDA/NASS/CDL”)\nDataset Provider: USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service\nData Used for our Study: cropland values for different crops of our study are used Wheat, Corn & Soybean Values provided from the Cropland Table. \n\n\nMOD13Q1.061 Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global It provides Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value on a per pixel basis.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“MODIS/061/MOD13Q1”)\nDataset Provider: NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS Center\nData Used for our Study: NDVI parameter of the dataset which provides the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. \n\n\nGRIDMET:Gridded Surface Meteorological Dataset It provides the high spatial resolution (~4-km) daily surface fields of temperature, precipitation, winds, humidity and radiation across the contiguous United States from 1979.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“IDAHO_EPSCOR/GRIDMET”)\nDataset Provider: USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service\nData Used for our Study: pr parameter of the dataset which provides the ‘Precipitation amount’ in mm (daily total) \n\n\nSentinel-1 SAR GRD It contains the boundary information i.e. counties of states which are the primary legal divisions units of US states.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“COPERNICUS/S1_GRD”)\nDataset Provider: European Union/ESA/Copernicus\nData Used for our Study: VV parameter of the dataset which provides ‘Single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive’ in dB. \n\nSPL3SMP_E.005 SMAP L3 Radiometer Global Daily 9km Soil Moisture It provides a daily composite of global land surface conditions retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-Band radiometer. The daily data here were collected from the descending (local solar time of 6 am) and ascending (local solar time of 6 pm) passes.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“NASA/SMAP/SPL3SMP_E/005”)\nDataset Provider: Google and NSIDC\nData Used for our Study: soil_moisture_am & soil_moisture_pmparameter of the dataset which provides ’Retrieved soil moisture estimate from the disaggregated/downscaled vertical polarization brightness temperature at 9-km grid cell one at AM overpass & other at PM overpass.in dB. \n\nMOD11A1.061 Terra Land Surface Temperature MOD11A1 V6.1 product provides daily land surface temperature (LST) along with other parameters.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“NASA/SMAP/SPL3SMP_E/005”)\nDataset Provider: NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS Center\nData Used for our Study: LST_Day_1km & LST_Night_1kmparameter of the dataset which provides ‘Daytime Land Surface Temperature’ & Daytime Land Surface Temperature’ both in Kelvin (K). \n\nMCD18C2.061 Photosynthetically Active Radiation Daily 3 hour The MCD18C2 Version 6.1 is a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) gridded Level 3 product produced daily at 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) resolution with estimates of PAR every 3 hours.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“MODIS/061/MCD18C2”)\nDataset Provider: NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS Center\nData Used for our Study: GMT_1200_PAR parameter of the dataset which provides ‘Total PAR at GMT 12:00’.PAR is incident solar radiation in the visible spectrum (400-700 nanometers) and is an important variable in land-surface models having use in agriculture & other scientific applications. \n\nMOD16A2GF.061: Terra Net Evapotranspiration It includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with MODIS remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. The pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite peri.\n\nDataset: ee.ImageCollection(“MODIS/061/MOD16A2GF”)\nDataset Provider: NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS Center\nData Used for our Study: ET parameter of the dataset which provides ‘Total evapotranspiration’ in kg/m^2/8day.s.  ice\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\n\n\nInterface\nHere is a presentation to show, how our application work:"
